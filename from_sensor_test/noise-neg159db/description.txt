Test data from TST5/6 used to verify accuracy of self-noise calculations.
Results trimmed to within 0:59:59.994 to 7:00:00. Single-component calc.
Here are respectively the PSD and noise expected results for each input:
TST5 00_LH0: -157.64, -158.53
TST5 10_LH0: -159.05, -160.79
TST6 00_LH0: -155.56, -156.33

All data uses a T-Compact response (Q330HR, BH-40) to get PSD estimations
