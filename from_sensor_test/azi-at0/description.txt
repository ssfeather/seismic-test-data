This tests data that is located at the same orientation as reference. That is, the azimuth calculation using this data should be at or very close to 0.
It is mainly used to ensure that circular mean is calculated correctly in the azimuth subroutines.
Specific trimming is probably not necessary but the test case implementing this check restricts the data from 12:00 to 14:00.
