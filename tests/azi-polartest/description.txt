This test checks that an azimuth solver can correctly identify data that is
180 degrees out from the reference angle. Initial implementation of the test
suite azimuth code used an orientation calculation that could be off by 180
degrees from the original data, due to being invariant to multiplying inputs
by -1. This test checks that the correction to this works as it should.
