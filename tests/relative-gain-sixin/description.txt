Data here uses the given channel 00 data as first set of inputs, 10 as second.
This is for six-input self noise in sensor suite, so order should be 1-2-Z for each.
Trim is from 10:00:00 to 14:00:00.
Resps are respective.
Expected result for gain should be ~1143 for north-facing data input (using first set of data as reference).
This data is used in another test where the data is loaded with 10 first but with
the 00 data still used as rotation and gain references; the results should be the same.
