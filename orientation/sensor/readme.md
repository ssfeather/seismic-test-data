## Description
This directory contains data from an STS-1 on an ASL test system that has the horizontal components set up at a non-orthogonal angle.

## Contents:

Three results have been produced for this test.  Data from before the sensors were moved, data after the sensors were moved and data after the angle between the sensors was corrected.  Thecorrection necessary as the first time the sensors were set at the non-orthogonal angle, the equipment needed to measure the angle was in the field and it was not as precise as we wanted.  When the digital compass returned to ASL, Kyle Persefield went up to the vault and reoriented the sensors.  He found that he was off by 1.5 degrees.  Processing with the test suite can pick out these small changes in angle. 

Currently the orientation angle calculation is off by 180.
